 **Reflection**

 **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
 Before the pairing session i wasn't completely ready for the markdown

 **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
 We went through almost everything. Why we use each type of commamds, the merge conflict, and the gits habits


 **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
 I ask some questions how to bring back the changes on the file when we switch, for that i have to switch to the master and use the git pull.
 I also ask how often do we need to fork .

 
 **What still confuses you about Git?**
 I am not confused at this point, I just have to practice more to get used to all the command and what to to.

 **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
 ```
 I was nervous but it went well.
